## Overview
CapinchoCalc is a command-line calculator and math expression parser, inspired by GNU calc.

Disclaimer: I did this as a challenge, so I didn't search anything on Google. Just wrote it from scratch trying to follow my own approach and intuition.

## Features
- Validates the input expression for correctness.
- Adds brackets to expressions following precedence order for accurate parsing.
- Parses and calculates mathematical expressions, supporting basic arithmetic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and exponentiation (^).
- Shows the result of each step during the calculation process.

## How to Use

You can directly pass the input as an argument to the program, like in the 'calc' command:
```bash
ccalc "(((56-23)*2^2-7)/12.5+(10-4+(10/5*3+54+2^2)+1)+1-2)/2^2"
```
